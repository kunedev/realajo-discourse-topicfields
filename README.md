## NB  A necessary element was deprecated.  It has been removed from this plugin and it is replaced within the realajo-discourse-coretheme

Deprecation notice: Defining connector classes via registerConnectorClass is deprecated. See https://meta.discourse.org/t/32727 for more modern patterns. [deprecation id: discourse.register-connector-class-legacy]

NOTE, the registerConnectorClass is deprecated.   I am leaving the commented-out code here in the plugin for reference for now. 
I am going to replace these calls within the Realajo Core Theme, not within this plugin. 
That is going to mean hard-coding the name as rtopicinfo but that is OK because all of the usage will be hard-coded anyway.
